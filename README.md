# Linelauncher
To simulate a rescue line launch, a firing range (figure 1) will be set up in an indoor space i.e. lecture theatre (minimum ceiling height 3 m), with a launch location pin and designated target area. Range is the distance from the device launch location pin to the centre of the target. The launch location pin is mounted 100 mm in from the rear most edge of a 600 x 600 mm small table. The target area (figure 2) is a series of circular concentric rings mounted over a circular container. Scoring will be judged by the ring space the ball first passes through on the target.
