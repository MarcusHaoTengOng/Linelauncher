# Linelauncher
To simulate a rescue line launch, a firing range will be set up in an indoor space i.e. lecture theatre (minimum ceiling height 3 m), with a launch location pin and designated target area. Range is the distance from the device launch location pin to the centre of the target. The launch location pin is mounted 100 mm in from the rear most edge of a 600 x 600 mm small table. The target area is a series of circular concentric rings mounted over a circular container. Scoring will be judged by the ring space the ball first passes through on the target.
Surfaces will be flat and level within normal building tolerances. Dimensions indicated Â± 2 mm. The table and target angles may vary and it will be down to competitors to align the launch device to the centre of the target. Consistency amongst heats will be maintained within the spirit of the competition.
The launch location pin is an M10 bolt, 50 mm long glued in place with approximately 30 mm of thread exposed. Devices are to be secured to the location pin using the 10 mm washer and wing nut provided. Clear access to the wing nut is required to enable the launcher to be easily secured/removed without disassembly.
